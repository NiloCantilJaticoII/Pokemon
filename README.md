# Pokemon

This project focuses on the battle simulation from the popular game, Pokemon. The mechanics of the game are simple. The user can attack, intake a potion to a Pokemon and switch out another Pokemon. The game is written entirely in C using Dev-C++ as its IDE.

# Compiling

## Windows

To compile in Windows, I'm not sure how it's done using the Windows Terminal or Command Prompt. However, using an IDE will make things easier.

## Mac/Linux

To compile, I use `clang <name>.c -o <name>`. Feel free to correct me if I'm mistaken as I don't use those machines often.
